# JavaScript mini project

I decided to explore using a couple different APIs that I've never used before: Youtube Search API and Wit.AI for natural language processing.

You can view the project on Github Pages [here](http://jnnivv.github.io/cc-lab/mike).

## Challenges

This was my first attempt with using a microphone input for voice processing -- it came with its obstacles, but overall it was rewarding!
